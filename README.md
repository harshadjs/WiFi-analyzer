What is WiFi analyzer?
----------------------
This is a simple tool that operates on a given WiFi trace and based on the air
occupancy of the packets, it examines your WiFi environment for the good and the
bad.

What can it be useful for?
-------------------------
This tool can be used to calculate average air occupancy in your WiFi environment.
Lower occupancy means the medium is not fully utilized and there is a scope for
improving your WiFi performance.

The tool also tells you the airtime wasted in retried frames. Possible reasons 
include interference from nearby APs, interference due to non-WiFi sources like
microwave oven, bluetooth devices etc.

WiFi analyzer shows average of Rates by which packets were transmitted. Lower
rates mean larger airtime for the same information. If rates are lower you
may want to upgrade the AP that supports better rates.
